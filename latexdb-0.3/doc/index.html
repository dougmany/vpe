This is LaTeX<i>DB</i>. The purpose of this project is to bring
together LaTeX and an SQL database. By using LaTeX<i>DB</i> you
can use SQL queries in your LaTeX document and loop over the
result sets, creating tables, serial letters and other stuff.
From version 0.2 on, LaTeX<i>DB</i> allows nesting of SQL queries.
LaTeX<i>DB</i> is released under the

[2006/04/24] Version 0.3 released which fixes the bug described in the next entry.
</p>

<p>
[2006/03/26] Some users noted a bug where LaTeXDB will terminate with an error (and no
output) when the size of a \texdbfor{} loop is too big. This is actually a stupid programming
mistake causing Python to recurse too deeply. I'll exchange the recursive code with an
iterative equivalent. Won't be long now ;)
</p>

<p>
[2005/10/27] There's a spanish introduction to LaTeXDB at <a href="http://caldum.um.es/~juanjo/?p=30">http://caldum.um.es/~juanjo/?p=30</a>.
</p>

<a name="intro">
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
LaTeX<i>DB</i> is pretty simple to use, there are only three
new commands to extend your LaTeX files: With them you define
a database connection, create queries and access the result sets.
</p>

<p>
You include commands such as
<pre>\texdbconnection{DBType,host,user,passwd,db}</pre>
to setup a database connection,
<pre>\texdbdef{##<i>query</i>}{select <i>var1</i>,<i>var2</i>,... from <i>table</i> where...}{##<i>VAR1</i>,##<i>VAR2</i>,...}</pre>
to define a query, and
<pre>\texdbfor{##<i>query</i>}{... some LaTeX stuff with ##<i>VAR1</i>, ...}</pre>
to use the results in your LaTeX code.
</p>


<a name="require">
<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
This relase of LaTeX<i>DB</i> supports MySQL and PostgreSQL. You
need Python (tested with version 2.2.2) and the Python <i>MySQLdb</i>
or <i>psycopg</i> module
for MySQL or PostgreSQL support, respectively. The database need not
be running on the local machine, since you can use any server
that you could also access from the <i>mysql</i> or similar command
line client.
</p>

<h3>Download / Release Notes</h3>


<p>
<b>Version 0.3 [2006/04/24]:</b>
latexdb-0.3.tgz <br>
A bug within the preparser that caused latexdb to break in texdbfor
loops with too big arguments was fixed
(contributed by Francois Meyer) <br>
- New script pdflatexdb which is the same as latexdb but calls pdflatex
instead of latex, so it generates PDF, not DVI files (user request)
</p>

<p>
<b>Version 0.2 [2003/08/20]:</b>
latexdb-0.2.tgz <br>
Queries can now be nested (refering to data from the upper query). <br>
Using MySQLdb modules instead of _mysql <br>
Extended to use PostgreSQL as well, code cleanup.
(contributed by Gerhard Kirchmann)
</p>

<p>
<b>Version 0.1 [2003/08/15]:</b>
latexdb-0.1.tgz <br>
Initial release, MySQL support
</p>


<a name="install">
<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
This is easy too: Grab the archive, unpack it, and run <i>install</i>
as <i>root</i>, or for minimum functionality copy
<i>latexdb</i>, <i>latexdb.py</i> and <i>latexdb-preparse.py</i> from
the <i>code</i> directory to <i>/usr/local/bin</i> or
some other directory that can be found in $PATH. Only put them in
the same directory, because <i>latexdb</i> expects <i>latexdb.py</i>
and <i>latexdb-preparse.py</i> in its own directory.
</p>


<a name="first">
<h3>First try</h3>

<p>
For a first try of LaTeX<i>DB</i> check the tiny tutorial in
<a href="workshop.html">workshop.html</a>. A more thorough
description can be found in
<i>reference.html</i> (not available yet). There are some examples
in the <i>examples</i> folder of the package. 
</p>


<a name="limits">
<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>
This is a quick hack, more a proof of concept.
One of the special commands introduced with LaTeX<i>DB</i> 
(the database connection) needs to
sit on a line of its own (and only one line), only the
commands for defining queries and using the result set can
use as many lines as you like and have other stuff in front
and behind.
</p>

<p>
The Python code is strictly procedural. Some people won't like
that since you're supposed to do objects in Python ;)  But I
couldn't be bothered. If anyone likes to write up this code
and make it follow standard Python programming more properly,
I'd be happy to see that code.
</p>

<p>
I have not included proper error condition checking. Do something
wrong, and the tool will break. It won't kill any of your files,
and it will even give some hint as to what was wrong while it
dies.
</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>
There's no point in trying to list all developers who have
created the software that I used. However, this program is here
thanks to the existence of Linux, MySQL, Python, TeX, LaTeX, and
lots of other stuff -- we tend to forget.
</p>

<p>
PostgreSQL support was contributed by Gerhard Kirchmann.
</p>

<p>
The man page was created using <i>manedit</i>,
