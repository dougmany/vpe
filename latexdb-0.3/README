To install this package, become root and type "./install" in
this directory. That will copy program files and documentation
to /usr/local/.

The examples/ directory contains two examples that will help
you get started. doc/ contains HTML files with a program
description, and there is also a manpage latexdb(1).

Have fun,  Hans-Georg
